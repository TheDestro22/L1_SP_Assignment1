# Purpose: Number scrabble is played with the list of numbers between 1 and 9. Each player takes
turns picking a number from the list. Once a number has been picked, it cannot be picked
again. If a player has picked three numbers that add up to 15, that player wins the game.
However, if all the numbers are used and no player gets exactly 15, the game is a draw.
